  <pre>DOCUMENT gy

 gy is a Yorick plug-in around GObject-introspection. It can
 notably be used to create Gtk GUIs from within Yorick. See gy_i
 for an introduction.

 The gy object itself gives access to the gobject introspection
 repository. It serves only one purpose: loading so called
 "namespace", which can be done very simply by dereferencing gy:
   Gtk = gy.Gtk;
 It is safer to use the "require" method below though.

METHODS:
 require: allows loading a specific version of a namespace:
               Gtk = gy.require("Gtk", "3.0");
          only one given version of a namespace can be loaded at a
          given time.

 documentation for g_irepository_<method>.

 gy is a Yorick plug-in around GObject-introspection. It can
 notably be used to create Gtk GUIs from within Yorick.

 gy_gtk.i contains convenience code for using the Gtk library
 through gy.

NAMESPACES
 Any library providing gobject-introspection can be accessed
 through this plug-in, as long as the gobject-introspection
 repository (GIR) files are installed on the system: under certain
 Linux systems, the corresponding package may be called
 "gir1.0-<libname>" or something similar. The notable example is
 Gtk.

 To load the GIR bindings for a given library, simply append the
 library's namespace to gy:
   Gtk = gy.Gtk;
 To load a specific version of a namespace (good idea for public
 code):
   Gtk = gy.require("Gtk", "3.0");

 You can use gy_list to list the symbols inside this
 namespace:
   gy_list, Gtk;

TYPE CLASSES AND OBJECTS
 A namespace (Gtk in this example) contains the definition of
 various types (object classes, C structures, enums...).

 Although some object classes provide one or several "new()"
 methods, the normal way is to just call the (object or structure)
 class as a function, passing properties or fields as keywords:
   button = gy.Gtk.Button.new_with_label("My Button");
 is thus equivalent to
   button = gy.Gtk.Button(label="My Button");
   
 Object members can also be listed with gy_list:
   gy_list, button;
   gy_list, Gtk.Button;
 (This only lists the available members and methods, not their
 value).

 Object/structure properties and fields can be set using the
 keyword notation, although specific "set_" methods are often
 provided:
   noop, button.set_label("other label");
   button, label="other label";
 They can be retrieved with either of:
   var = button.label;
   val = button.get_label(); // if applicable
   button, label, var;
 The last form is convenient and performant when retrieving several
 properties at a time:
   button, xalign, x, yalign, y;
 Hyphens in properties or filed names in the C documentation are
 replaced with underscores in the Yorick implementation.

 Methods and other member functions are accessed by extracting them
 with the dot operator (which produces a closure), then calling the
 closure. In simpler words, this works as expected:
   object.method(arguments);
 Note that the coma syntax does not work in this context. The two
 following are equivalent to hide the output value from a method
 call:
   closure = object.method; closure, arguments;
   noop, object.method(arguments);

 Enum values are accessed likewise:
   var = gy.Gtk.MessageType.error;
 Beware that C documentation may list enum values are CPP
 macros. Those aliases are not accessible within Yorick, only the
 fully qualified name. For instance, GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR is one value
 of type GtkMessageType. In Yorick you access it as
 gy.Gtk.MessageType.error.
 
 
 Callbacks can be connected to objects using gy_signal_connect.

 gy simply exposes conforming library content to Yorick. See the
 relevant library C API documentation for more details, for
 instance:
