Version 0.0.2
    * Don't start the loop in gy_gtk.i, instead start it in gy_gtk_main
	and stop it using gy_gtk_maybe_stop in hide/destroy callbacks
	if there are no remaining windows shown. Codes that relied on the
	loop running constantly must call gy_gtk_main somewhere.
    * gy_gtk_suspend is deprecated in favor of gy_gtk_hide_on_delete.
    * gy_gtk_ywindow_free_id check also regular yorick windows.
    * Fix the majority o memory leaks affecting cubeview. Some
	remain. Provide gy_object_free to free objects without ref
	counter.
    * split gy.c into many sub-pieces.
    * fix autoloads (only support functions)
    * update examples relative to recent changes
    * better (but unfinished) support for array types
    * ypush/get_g(u)int?? macros
    * allow accessing G(S)List data by index
    * improve G(S)List support, add .size member
    * fix hide_on_delete behaviour for gycmap
    * add gy_gtk_mouse(), which installs itself as mouse()
    * gy_gtk_idler, 0 now stops the loop in all cases before reinstanciating
	itself
    * Small bug fixes.
